# Clock
# This project uses the basic HTML, CSS and Javascript.
# This project shows the analog clock and IST Time.
# In the HTML code, a div is made with a id containor. Inside that div, 3 div are made with id hour, minute, second respectively.
# A CSS file is made to design the analog clock
# In javascript, SetInterval() function is made which stores the date in the variable "date".
# Then we use date.getHours(); date.getMinutes(); date.getSeconds(); to get the hours, minutes and seconds respectively and store this in variables "htime", "mtime", "stime" respectively.
# Then we use formulas to get the rotation of hour hand, minute hand and seconds hand.
# Then we used the transform attribute of style to rotate the hands according to the rotation we obtained in the previous step.
